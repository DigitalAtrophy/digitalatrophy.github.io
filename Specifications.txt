Users should be able to:
*Learn about New Carpa Collective; who they are and what they do
*View a list of upcoming events
*View a calendar of events and be able to subscribe to it
*Submit a form to receive more information from New Carpa Collective
*View information on New Carpa Collective's members

New Carpa Collective should be able to:
*Automatically receive an email containing form information from users
*Add events to calendar, which also updates upcoming events list
*Add bios for new members

What I have left to do:
*Lookup calendar subscription service
*"Contact Us" form that sends email automatically
*Way to simulate dynamic website, but create static pages
